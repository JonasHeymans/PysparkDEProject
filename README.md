# PysparkDEProject
Contains code for a project from my Data Engineering Project

On the off-chance that you would like to use any of the code here. 
Feel free to do so. (I don't own code, obviously)
Although, if you intend to use relatively large code snippets, please cite me as a source.

No need to ask for permission, just refer to here.
Have a nice day!
